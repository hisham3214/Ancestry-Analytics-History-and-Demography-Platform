n recent years, efforts to reshape historical narratives through data manipulation
have become increasingly visible, with population data serving as a particularly
sensitive point of contention. An example of this can be seen in the case of
Palestine, where varying population figures from the pre-Nakba period reflect
how demographic data can be skewed to support specific narratives. However,
this issue is not limited to any one region; globally, population estimates often
vary significantly between sources, particularly in periods marked by impactful
events such as wars, natural disasters, and pandemics. The infrequent nature of
censuses—typically conducted only every 5–10 years—compounds this problem
by leaving gaps that may inadequately reflect the effects of these events.
Our project addresses this challenge by creating a software solution that cross-
references population data from multiple sources, aiming to produce more accu-
rate demographic estimates that consider the influence of major events. Through
the integration of diverse datasets and advanced algorithms, we seek to offer a
balanced and reliable reflection of population trends, which could help to rec-
tify historical inaccuracies and provide a clearer understanding of demographic
realities.
In developing this project, we face several technical constraints, including
the need for robust security measures to protect sensitive data, adherence to
web crawling limitations, and issues surrounding the quality and availability of
historical population data, especially for periods before the 1960s. Additionally,
non-technical challenges are present, including the ethical obligation to handle
data responsibly and the political sensitivity of potentially revealing discrepancies
or fabrications in population records.
Our solution involves building a comprehensive database supported by web
crawlers and APIs to collect population, birth, and death data from various
sources. Once the data is stored, we plan to use artificial intelligence to generate
estimates that account for impactful events, allowing for a more accurate de-
mographic representation. An interactive map will serve as the visual interface,
displaying these enhanced estimates in an accessible and engaging way.
Progress so far includes the development of a functional web crawler and
integration with relevant APIs, a database to store the data, and the creation
of the interactive map. Next steps involve automating data insertion into the
iii
database and implementing AI algorithms to refine our estimates. Through these
efforts, we aim to provide a tool that will help reveal a more comprehensive picture
of population dynamics across different periods and regions.
